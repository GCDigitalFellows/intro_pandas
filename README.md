# Introduction to Data Analysis with Python and Pandas

This is a solid workshop that can be both taught as a stand-alone workshop or as part of the Python track on the digital institutes.

## Credits
This workshop was co-written by [Rafael Davis Portela](https://github.com/rafadavis) and [Patrick Smyth](https://github.com/smythp).

## Workshops
It was first taught at CUNY GC by Rafael Davis Portela in the Spring of 2021 as a two hour online syncronous workshop.

Abstract: 

> In this hands-on workshop, we will learn the basics of data exploration, analysis and visualization with Python. 
> We will introduce and work with the Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook, tools that have become the standard for data analysis with Python. 
> Some introductory Python knowledge is necessary, since we will not have time to go over the basics during the workshop. But do not let that scare you. 
> If you take our online Introduction to Python workshop ( https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/python ) before coming to this one, you will be fine. 
> This workshop will be held online with Zoom."

## Requirements
- Students need to be familiar with the Python language. We should suggest them to take the Intro to Python workshop first.
- Students should install Anaconda on their computers, so they have Jupyter Notebook and all the libraries we use.
  - Alternatively, students can use Google Colab, which runs in the browser and require no installation. 
- It would benefit students if they came to this workshop with some basic notions of how Jupyter Notebook works (or Google Colab, if that's the case).
Any 5-10 minute long tutorial on youtube should be enough for that. Whoever is leading the workshop should give them the link.

## Reception and Feedback
Feedback was very good. Students liked the content, depth and pace.

## Needed/Desired Changes 
Students also requested for this workshop to be longer. 
A 3-hour long session with a break (15 to 30 minutes) in the middle would probably be ideal.
The current version of the workshop has no challenges/exercises. 
Adding a couple of them should be enough to extend the duration of the workshop.
